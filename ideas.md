<!-- The world needs an awesome app to watch the stars!

	I think we should be able to:

	CREATE A SUPERIOR STAR DATABASE:
		-Pulling information from that 'other' internet movie database, create your own custom star constellations! It's like a friends circle but for people you'll never meet, peon!
		-Find out esoteric information: preffered housing arrangements; least favorite scents; smallest pet owned as a child.
				*note: information availability subject to change or non-existence.

	SIX STEPS TO KEVIN BACON:
		-Delicious, delicious bacon. Want to see exactly how these stars align? Find out how with our Baconator (title pending):
			-See how many steps removed they are from Kevin (or anyone else)!
			-See what those steps are! (Did you know that the dog that played Beethoven was owned and trained by Karl Lewis Miller, who also trained animals for Cujo, which might in some way be related to Kevin Bacon? I'm no good at this game; that's what this part of the app is for!) 

	TRACK YOUR FAVORITE STARS ONLINE:
		-See what sites they're posting to!
		-Depending on the information they're putting out there, find out a PHYSICAL location from which they post! Ooh! Stalky!
			-Where did they eat?
			-Where are they sleeping?
				-With whom? Hyuk hyuk.


	AVOID NEWS FROM YOUR LEAST FAVORITE STARS (UNLESS THEY GET INJURED):
		-Can't stand Ryan Seacrest? Use our censoring service- don't worry about ever seeing his name pop up here! Unless he's in trouble!


	STAY AWAY FROM GARY BUSEY:
		-We don't have any information on Gary Busey. -->

		JUMP'n Jehosephat! I was originally talking about a constellation finding App! not celebrities! what a conundrum.

		here is the features list for the CONSTELLATION finder.

		Starfinder Application IOS
---------------------------
Overview
--------
The purpose of this application is to further educate the general masses in regards to locating constellations as well as other inter-planetary constructs. the app should be as invisible as possible. meaning: the user should hardly notice the process of going from normal phone use to navigating the stars with ease.
Features
--------
* Translucent styling and menus
* gps location is a given regarding the global positioning of the interface overlay(what part of the world is this person in?)
* use  built in gyroscope and accelerometer to help de-limit the use of the device (being inherently mobile)
* built in camera feeds what the user sees and displays an overlay of the star map on top of the phones live camera feed(not recorded though as this would compound data locally on the device.)
* the application will pull from NASA's hubble photograph database to clearly show celestial bodies that users are unable to see using the native zoom functions of the mobile device.{http://archives.esac.esa.int/hst/}
* constellation database will be mined from{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/} (they have all listed cellestial objects in the known universe.)
* graphical overlay will be vector constructed so the application can be used in educational settings requiring larger veiwing experiences
* GUI will also include a compass that communicates with the device's native gyroscope.
* 2 display options, one for night viewing and the other for day time veiwing for activities such as finding the north star(Polaris)ect...
* the app will be made available for sale  in the Apple App Store for $4.99 starting June 29, 2014.
